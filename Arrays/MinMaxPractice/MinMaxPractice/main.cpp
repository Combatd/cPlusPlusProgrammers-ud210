/*Find the min and max and average of 15 numbers that a user will input.
**The numbers range from 0 to 100.
**We will do it now for practice and again later when we learn arrays and
**functions. So you do not have to keep all fifteen numbers stored in memory.
**HINT: you will need to use scanf for input text.
